# Test_Classification_CNN_tensorflow
This is a project for classifying IMDB movie reviews by using Convolutional Neural Network, It is implemented in tensorflow. 
The model is used in this project is similar to Yoon Kim's Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, but it is not exactly the same with it.
Dataset can be found here; http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ .

Epoch: 200 loss: 0.877207 accuracy: 0.44

Epoch: 300 loss: 0.759178 accuracy: 0.52

  For Test set:
  
Epoch 0 loss: 1.60755 accuracy: 0.41

Epoch 100 loss: 1.42304 accuracy: 0.48

Epoch 200 loss: 1.21466 accuracy: 0.56

Epoch 300 loss: 1.16337 accuracy: 0.58


Accuracy can be increased by using pre-trained word2vec.

You can specify the path according to your path where the dataset is in.
